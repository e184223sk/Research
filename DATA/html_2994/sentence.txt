More than 1 year has passed since last update.A serial RFID reader can be read using DataReader with the help of SerialPort that is being used to find the connected port in the system.Then we need to configure the serial settingsAnd from that serial port InputStream, we can read the data from the serial device.Reference link: https://github.com/phanithken/RFIDReader
